JoeBot is a DiscordBot which uses discord.py and can be used for a few different things including getting reddit posts.

## Future Development

Discord.py, which JoeBot uses, has stopped development and Discord will be switching to slash commands in April 2022 [1] meaning this might stop working then. This means that I will not be adding any new features untill I either port it to a different API or someone forks discord.py to add support.
